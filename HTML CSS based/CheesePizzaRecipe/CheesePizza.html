        <p>Pizza cheese encompasses several varieties and types of cheeses and dairy products that are designed and manufactured for use specifically on pizza. These include processed and modified cheese such as mozzarella-like processed cheeses and mozzarella variants. The term can also refer to any type of cheese suitable for use on pizza. The most popular cheeses used in the preparation of pizza are <span id="mpcp">mozzarella, provolone, cheddar and Parmesan</span>. Emmental, Romano and ricotta are often used as toppings, and processed pizza cheeses manufactured specifically for pizza are mass-produced. Some mass-produced pizza cheeses are frozen after manufacturing and shipped frozen.</p>
        <p>I Love cheese pizza because it is <span id="srac">sweet, rich and complex</span>.Cheese is fatty, toppings tend to be rich and the sauce is sweet.No matter what type of cooking method is used, the delicious smell of a pizza straight out of the oven is unmatched in this world. The secret to a good pizza lies not just in the crust, but in the sauce as well. A tomato-based sauce can be sweet, salty, spicy or seasoned.</p>
